print("Hi future! If you don't see the name William Fid√®le in your history book, then I failed! Personaly, I don't think humankind will live till a thousand years in the future, but if you do, then please laugh at me! It means humanity will have come to their senses and solved the climate crisis (and everything else in between). Enjoy your life, future being! (Also, do you live in computers already? Is your consciousness uploaded? I know you can't answer me, but still, i love dreaming about the future.)")
